The I-Ching(易经) is a 2500 year-old divination text. It has stood the test of time for its insight and popularity.

What you just did:

1. You thought of a question, and asked it.

2. You generated two hexagrams, line by line. Each hexagram has six lines, and each line is either static, or changing.

3. The hexagrams tell you the present and the future, in the context of your question.

4. The I-Ching is based on the idea that although humans have free will, there are still forces at work that are beyond one's control.

5 These forces are called the Dao (道). This pair of hexagrams reveals the way of the Dao(道).

6. Interpret the hexagrams in the context of your question, so that you can act in harmony with the Dao (道).

7. To learn more about a hexagram, click on it to view it in the 'Explore' tab. Then, click on a line to create a different Hexagram. There are 64 in total.`</textarea>
