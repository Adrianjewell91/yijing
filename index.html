        <p>1. On this website, you can generate two hexagrams using an authentic coin-flip method. You can also click on any of the lines to transform them into other hexagrams.<br />
        2. The hexagrams tell you the present and the future in the context of your question.<br />
        3. Your hexagrams may be identical. Thats okay!<br />
        4. The I-Ching is based on the idea that, although humans have free will, there are forces beyond one's control.<br />
        5. These forces are called the Dao (道). The hexagrams reveal the way of the Dao(道).<br />
        6. Interpret the hexagrams in the context of your question, so that you can act in harmony with the Dao (道).<br />
        7. To learn about a hexagram, click on it.</p>
