WHAT JUST HAPPENED:

The I-Ching(易经) is a 2500 year-old divination text. Its insight and value have stood the test of time.

1. You thought of a question.

2. You generated two hexagrams, with an authentic coin-flip method. Each hexagram has six lines, and each line is either static, or changing.

3. The hexagrams tell you the present and the future, in the context of your question.

4. The I-Ching is based on the idea that although humans have free will, there are still forces beyond one's control.

5 These forces are called the Dao (道). The hexagrams reveal the way of the Dao(道).

6. Interpret the hexagrams in the context of your question, so that you can act in harmony with the Dao (道).

7. To learn about a hexagram, CLICK ON IT. Then, click on a line to learn about a different Hexagram. There are 64 in total.`</textarea>
