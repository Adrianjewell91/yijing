# I Ching (易经) - Comprehensive E-Text and Fortune Teller:

## Background and Overview
While working as a teacher in China, I discovered the I Ching, roughly translated as 'The Book of Changes.' As one of the oldest texts in the world, the I Ching (易经) has a long history as a divination text. Its contents have also been used recreationally, for instance, by the composer John Cage, as an aid in musical composition.  

The goal of this project is to introduce users to the Book of Changes, help users explore its contents, and give them a tool for usage.

When using the I Ching, two of the sixty-four hexagrams are generated. They tell the user the 'Present Situation' and the 'Future situation', respectively. A traditional coin-toss method determines the six lines of the hexagram.  

The author's personal goals include improving his skill in vanilla Javascript, HTML 5 canvas, and CSS. Secondary goals include understanding small databases, and familiarizing himself with the Chinese language in the context of web-development.   

## Technologies

I Ching uses vanilla JavaScript and DOM Manipulation, HTML5 Canvas, and CSS3.

Webpack bundles the `.js` scripts into a `bundle.js`.

## Features

Feature Include:

When Consulting the Oracle:
1. Asking a question to the oracle.
2. Building the Hexagrams sequentially, line-by-line, using the traditional coin-flipping sorting method.
3. View the resultant hexagrams. When mousing over the hexagram, users can click the hexagram and explore it further in the Hexagram viewer.

In The Hexagram Viewer:
1. Explore the 64 Hexagrams via selector input.
2. Click on any of the six lines to switch that line between Yin and Yang, and view the new Hexagram.
3. View the Hexagram's name, title, and description on mouse-over.

The content should be tastefully styled, and organized for the best possible user experience.
