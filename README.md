# I Ching (易经) - A Fortune Telling Experience:

## Background and Overview

The Book of Changes was one of my discoveries while living in China. As one of the oldest books in the world, the I Ching (易经) has a long history of usage as a tool for divination. Its contents have also been used recreationally, by the composer John Cage, for example, as an aid in musical composition.  

The goal of this project is to introduce users to the Book of Changes and provide an intuitive interface for exploration of its contents, and utilization of the contents for divination.  

The author's personal goals include improving his skill in vanilla Javascript, HTML 5 canvas, and CSS. Secondary goals include understanding small databases, and familiarizing himself with the Chinese language in the context of web-development.   

No additional libraries will be used.
