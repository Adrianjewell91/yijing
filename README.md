# I Ching (易经) - Comprehensive E-Text and Fortune Teller:

## Background and Overview
While working as a teacher in China, I discovered the I Ching, roughly translated as 'The Book of Changes.' As one of the oldest texts in the world, the I Ching (易经) has a long history as a divination text. Its contents have also been used recreationally, for instance, by the composer John Cage, as an aid in musical composition.  

The goal of this project is to introduce users to the Book of Changes, help users explore its contents, and give them a tool for usage.

When using the I Ching, two of the sixty-four hexagrams are generated. They tell the user the 'Present Situation' and the 'Future situation', respectively. A method for generating one of four possible outcomes is used to generate the lines of the hexagrams.    

The author's personal goals include improving his skill in vanilla Javascript, HTML 5 canvas, and CSS. Secondary goals include understanding small databases, and familiarizing himself with the Chinese language in the context of web-development.
